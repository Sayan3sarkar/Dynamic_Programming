# Dynamic Programming

According to educative.io,

> Dynamic Programming (DP) is an algorithmic technique for solving an optimization problem by breaking it down into simpler subproblems and utilizing the fact that the optimal solution to the overall problem depends upon the optimal solution to its subproblems.

## Problems solved here using both C++ and Python

1. Knapsack
    * 0/1 Knapsack
        * Recursive
        * Memoization(Top-Down approach)
        * Tabulation(Bottom-Up approach)
    * Subset_Sum(all using Tabulation)(variations of 0/1 Knapsack)
        * Is Subset Sum
        * Equal Partition Sum
        * Count of Subsets with given sum
        * Minimum Subset Sum Difference
        * Count of Subsets with given difference(another variation of exact same problem is Target Sum)
    * Unbounded Knapsack
        * Rod Cutting
        * Coin Change: Max number of coins
        * Coin change: Min number of coins
